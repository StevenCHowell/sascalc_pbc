# Notes from @ianhi
## Requires

nbstripout
`pip install nbstripout`

Do not use git kracken when commiting .ipynb files as it doesn't seem to run the proper nbstripout command.
Rather you should commit from the command line.

## Data Files
Are located on Ian's computer and should be placed in `/home/data/sascaclc_pbc`
